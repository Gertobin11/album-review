# Album Review (placeholder)

A website for people to see other users album reviews, post their own reviews and create a wishlist of albums they like.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the project would be massive as it would cover every genre of music. While initially the project would be scoped with a set amount of genres this will be expanded on user input, which will be a major feature, and also from browsing the reviews , where I think certain albums do not fit in a currently available category. Depending on the users the project attracts, future features could be tailored towards those users. Thi would be aimed at music affetionados who are aged between 25 - 55, who are looking for something a bit different from the usual offering of music on the internet.

## Business Logic

Initially it would just be set up as a review site, where there is scope to link the albums to an online shop as an affiliate program, the goal would be eventually to stock our own albums and sell them online through an ecommerce extension of the website. This would preferably done through vinyls as this is an emerging trend with people who are tired of the digital music scene.

## UX

### Colour Scheme 

The site colour scheme is based around having dark backgrounds, with a dark overlay on some background pictures. 
This is then contrasted with bright CTA buttons links and content boxes. 
The contrasting colours are the default gold and a bright red (#ee4b2b)

### Typography

The fonts chosen for this site are 'Eczar' for headings and titles.
Then for the main text and paragraphs 'Arapey' is used. 

### Layout

THe Layout for this site relies on Flex for the dynmaic layouts. Alot of this was learned from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw). In more static and structured places like index.html grid was used. Again I learned most of this from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) and also [WEB Dev Simplified]()
