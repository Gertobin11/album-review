# Album Review (placeholder)

A website for people to see other users album reviews, post their own reviews and create a wishlist of albums they like.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the project would be massive as it would cover every genre of music. While initially the project would be scoped with a set amount of genres this will be expanded on user input, which will be a major feature, and also from browsing the reviews , where I think certain albums do not fit in a currently available category. Depending on the users the project attracts, future features could be tailored towards those users.

## Business Logic

Initially it would just be set up as a review site, where there is scoe to link the albums to an online shop as an affiliate program, the goal would be eventually to stock our own albums and sell them online through an ecommerce extension of the website.
