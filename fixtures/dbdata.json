"fields": {"album": 1, "title": "Vintage Hip Hop", "content": "The year is 1992, the place is Staten Island, and a 23-year-old RZA is in the process of masterminding a Hip-Hop collective that will revolutionize both the sound and the business of Hip-Hop forever. The idea was to make a huge crew consisting of razor-sharp MC's who were all capable of being amazing solo artists in their own right, and by having them on separate labels they could diversify their assets so to speak. But they weren't simply going to be artists, they were going to be entrepreneurs all investing in a new brand called: Wu-Tang. This particular brand came from the rugged streets of Shaolin and was paving its own sound and style and creating a worldwide audience that would stretch from the slums of Shaolin to all corners of the globe. And despite being a massively popular movement in the Hip-Hop world, the sound was decidedly rugged, ruff, creative and original to a tee. All of the marks of their unique style are present on '36 Chambers' although they would only continue to develop and mature in all aspects on their subsequent releases.  \r\n\r\nLyrically this is a masterful battle rap album, with hundreds of ferocious bars delivered by some of the hungriest, most talented and creative MC's to ever grab the mic. Drawing on their many inspirations these talented young MC's never cease to entertain with their pop culture references, humor, and raw energy. While the majority of the album's lyrics have the vibe of a cipher on the corner, there are three tracks that stand out lyrically with more of a storytelling style. The first track that uses this approach is the soulful and chilled out track 'Can't It All Be So Simple' which is the first time we get to hear Raekwon and Ghostface team up with their complementary styles. The second track in this mold is the classic C.R.E.A.M. with its famous acronym (Cash Rules Everything Around Me) with its memorable piano loop coupled with 'growing up hard' lyrics by Raekwon and Inspectah Deck, the track is topped off with the classic chorus by Method Man. The last storytelling track is the highly dramatic, and visual 'Tearz' where RZA paints a picture of a traumatic and violent experience on streets, while Ghostface chimes in with a story about HIV/AIDS. Observing the Wu-Tang Clan and the solo projects that followed there is one thing that is blatantly apparent, and that's how the Clan delivered a sound and style that was amazingly original and unorthodox not only lyrically, but certainly on the production side also, where RZA created soundscapes that were catchy, atmospheric, and rugged all while being decidedly non-commercial. That's a mighty hard combination to pull off but the RZA did it with flying colors by creating a style all his own yet still accessible enough to capture audiences across the globe and inspire an entire planet of upcoming Hip-Hop artists to follow his lead. Most of the tracks on '36 Chambers' have a funky and hardcore vibe (something that would be less present on their next album: 1997's 'Wu-Tang Forever'), on this album the strength of the beats is an undeniable catchiness and funky rhythmic quality that suits the high energy rapping perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum the inclusion, 'Can It All Be So Simple\", 'C.R.E.A.M.', 'Tearz' add a melodic and relaxed element that rounds out the album's hardcore street battle atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAdding to the charm of the album are the skits, the most famous one being the 'Torture Skit' where Raekwon and Method Man try to out-do each other in creating the most excruciating torture scenarios. They do a great job at this and the skit is both horrific and hilarious to listen to, undoubtedly making it one of Hip-Hop's classic skits. The album actually has several smaller skits scattered throughout the tracklist making this a very good skit album also.\r\nAfter it's release late in 1993, the album peaked at 41 on the Billboard charts and wasn't certified platinum until May 15, 1995. So it was game-changer despite being a slow burner saleswise. Nonetheless, it was the firecracker that set off a stream of rapid releases from '94-'97, which were all produced by RZA and each with their unique sounds. An amazing start for Hip-Hop's most exciting, memorable and beloved crew.", "rating": 9, "date_created_on": "2022-06-15T22:03:22.731Z", "date_edited_on": null, "creator": 1}}, {"model": "reviews.review", "pk": 3, "fields": {"album": 2, "title": "Test Title", "content": "\"I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust\r\nSo many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us\r\nSay they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin\r\nStraight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin\"\r\n\r\nMe Against the World is definitely a big reason why Tupac broke into the mainstream of hip hop while still being sentenced, but that album wasn't enough for him. After being helped out of jail by Suge Knight, he joined forces with Death Row empire and decided to help the label crush all the other mainstream rap families one last time, thanks to Suge and his business sense. Tupac started working on his 3 album deal and what resulted was a shit load of songs, his vaults from that era seem to be endless as he was just gushing with inspiration and those leftovers are still released... Okay some were done earlier in the Nineties. Anyway, during his stay at Death Row Tupac did 2 totally different albums, one of them was his Makaveli album that he recorded all for himself, out of pure inspiration and rage, but the other one was this All Eyez on Me. One of the rap's earliest double albums (inspiring a ton of other rappers to try that shit too) and probably the best selling hip hop album in United States, Pac admitted he recorded this one for Suge but after discovering how creative he was at the time and what made him so great at writing these classics, it's even easier to appreciate the work he did on this one.\r\n\r\nMost of rap fans know Tupac from this exact style. Thug Life Outlaw gone pop. His Greatest Hits compilation is filled with All Eyez on Me for nothing, this album is just a classic after another... So on its concept you can consider this album as Pac's celebration of life, this is on the other hand an ultimate party record as this production style is a massive, grandiose blend of West Coast funk and pop elements, but also shit goes way deeper than just simple party hip hop. Tupac was pretty much on the top of his rap game at the time, his ability to write amazing songs and passion are so captivating and even some of his songs for the dance floor have some social commentary or straight boasting, going on and on about his \"enemies\". That's a subject he would attack with full speed on the Makaveli album but it's obvious that his paranoid reaction to Bad Boy family was one of his major motivators to write some of classics on All Eyez on Me like \"Can't C Me\". Still, on the whole this is just a feel good rap album top to bottom and listening to it is almost too easy, especially the first disc \"Book 1\" is probably the finest run of hip hop music ever. Second disc is slightly worse than the first one because it ain't nearly as catchy, mostly due to the fact that the beats are ultimately darker and not as pop as the beats on \"Book 1\". To put it short, first half of All Eyez on Me is for pop crowds featuring rap superstars of its time and a West Coast gangsta party. It's impossible to decide the best song off that one: Dr. Dre jam \"California Love\", Method Man and Redman assisted \"Got My Mind Made Up\", the girl joint \"How Do U Want It\", passionate \"Life Goes On\".... That side is just plain flawless but the second half which is definitely more of Outlaw attitude and mostly produced by Johnny J, is damn good too and if you have the patience to get into these tracks you're bound to get another disc of Tupac classics. Johnny J ain't no Dre or Daz, but Tupac carries the weight sometimes all on his own. \"Picture Me Rollin'\" and \"All Eyez on Me\" are only some of my favorites...\r\n\r\nListening to All Eyez on Me is one of my favorite things to do. To be completely frank, it's impossible to think that a rap fan should hate this album at all even if it is massively commercial. It's inevitable that if only the best 15-16 songs were taken for this one All Eyez on Me would be easily the greatest rap album ever, but in this case the fact that an album is a double one doesn't matter at all. In fact, in my opinion there's no filler to be found here. Say what? That's right I love all these 27 songs (pro tip: do like they did in UK and add the radio edit of California Love as the finisher 28th track, you can't go wrong with that one), to think about a hip hop album that has more replay value is pretty damn difficult. Now that's where the album's double disc attribute become's its biggest strength: there's just way too much good stuff on this one and you can not digest all of it on one sitting. And you really think Tupac is \"dumbed down\" on All Eyez on Me? Yes some of his songs are about partying but who gives a fuck about that? He goes on and on about a whole lot of other stuff on this album, just pay attention to other songs than \"All Bout U\" if you want Pac to be deep. Out of all party rappers, Tupac is easily the greatest of them all because not only he can make the production on All Eyez on Me better than it actually is, becoming an essential part of the beats themselves and making the instrumental versions of these songs blasphemy, but Tupac also wrote these songs full of double meanings and hidden jabs. That's where his legacy as a \"rapping poet\" is at its most obvious. So the more I think about it, the more I appreciate All Eyez on Me. Not only is it the best Tupac Shakur album but also pretty much one of the best rap albums ever. Both seasoned hip hop veterans and newcomers alike must hear this album, there's a whole lot to digest even if it's one of the most accessible rap albums on Earth. All Eyez on Me cements Tupac's position as one of the most important rappers ever and to think of an influential hip hop album than this one is almost damn impossible. Not a damn bit overrated if you ask me, probably the best West Coast rap album! No one has been able to duplicate his style, and I think it's no use to hold one's breath waiting for a rapper like Tupac Shakur to step into the scene. Even if he is still alive out there somewhere - which is highly unlikely though - I think you should just take advice from the Poet himself: \"life goes on\".", "rating": 10, "date_created_on": "2022-06-17T21:45:02.007Z", "date_edited_on": null, "creator": 1}}, {"model": "reviews.review", "pk": 4, "fields": {"album": 3, "title": "Test Title", "content": "Every generation of musicians seems to have a figure that inspires the less talented among us to push on to greater heights. In the 70’s, untalented punks were motivated by the sight of Sid Vicious joining a band without knowing how to play his instrument; the 80’s saw Milli Vanilli climb to the top of the charts without ever singing the songs on their records; and more recently, the insanely annoying Crazy Frog has sold ten kajillion ringtones without even being a real person.\r\n\r\nFor the 90’s, that figure was Rob Van Winkle, AKA Vanilla Ice. Along with MC Hammer and the aforementioned Milli Vanilli, Ice helped establish a triad of “musical” acts that is mocked and ridiculed to this day. And while Milli Vanilli had a ridiculous gimmick, but did not make altogether ridiculous music, the other two did. MC Hammer was merely a rapper that didn’t know how to rap; Vanilla, on the other hand, trumped him by being a white rapper that didn’t know how to rap. Furthermore, he fabricated an entire backstory as a gangbanger (in the ‘hood way, not the sexual way) that, while at first deceiving the public, soon became transparent, allowing said public to Rip Van Winkle a new one. (See what I did there?)\r\n\r\nNone of this, however, prevented either Ice or Hammer from selling millions of records. For Vanilla, his big 15 minutes came with debut album To The Extreme, released in 1990.\r\n\r\nNow, did you ever hear that phrase “it was still the 80’s in 1990”? To The Extreme validates this statement, because nowhere in the jaded post-Nirvana musical scene would this album achieve any kind of commercial success. No, my friends – this belongs in an era of aberrantly-coloured spandex, atrocious haircuts and synth-driven dance music, who gladly lapped this up alongside their Kid'N'Play and their Cyndi Laupers.\r\n\r\nSo what do we get on this record? Well, you know when someone is trying to parody hip-hop? You know that stilted flow they deliver while their friend goes “boom-tshee-boom” with their mouth trying to sound like a boombox? Well, Vanilla Ice sounds exactly like that, except with an even worse electronic beat and some atrocious lyricism. With your drunk buddy, you at least get to have a few laughs at his expense; Van winkle, however, sounds terribly serious about it all, as he brags about how good he is with a mic and how women love him. Seriously, that’s all he talks about. His points are rammed home with the inclusion of female voices in different degrees of trance with Ice’s abilities. And he’s so goddamn literal! The second verse of Ice Ice Baby is a detailed description of a car-ride, while Hooked meticulously describes a visit to the psychiatrist. Great lyrical material, huh?!\r\n\r\nThe songwriting is also predictably atrocious. Not only are Vanilla’s raps always about the same thing, his rhyming choices are laughable and his flow never really “flows”, instead consisting of broken, breathy rhythmic talking that is often out of time with the beat. And while this is mildly amusing on superhit Ice Ice Baby, it eventually starts to grate, especially because every other song on this album sound exactly the same. By the time Ice lets loose with the Mary Poppins catchphrase, we’re way past caring.\r\n\r\nSeriously, there comes a point where you feel like you’ve been listening to the same track for 30 minutes. There are only two instances in the entire album where Vanilla uses a different beat, and even then, his one-note rapping makes the track all too familiar. On Life Is a Fantasy, there is a slower beat, but Ice’s vocals entirely negate it. However, you haven’t lived until you’ve hear Rosta Man (sic), where Vanilla infuses his plastic beat with a fake reggae vibe and attempts a dreadful Caribbean accent. The track ends up being surprisingly not-horrible, but hearing that Jamaican dude say ”strictly from da i’laaahndz…Vanilla Ice” always cracks me up. Rob Van Winkle has about as much Caribbean in him as a Twinkie has nutritional value.\r\n\r\nThe lyrical rock bottom is attained on Dancin’, which kicks off with the lyrical gem ”come on everybody, come on everybody, come on everybody, come on come on everybody” (sic). The track later degenerates into a ridiculous roll-call for American states, which succeeds in making it even more ridiculous than it already was.\r\n\r\nWhat’s even more infuriating is the fact that Ice has some really good backing samples that a real MC would kill for. Go Ill has The Almighty James Brown Sample, while Stop That Train has a female r’n’b sample that a good MC would put to great use. The same can be said for the sax on Hooked, which also helps make it a not-horrible track – as long as we forget the vocals.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, however, there are very few redeeming qualities to this record. It’s hard to describe how horrible stuff like Stop That Train or the turgid Ice Is Workin’ It really is, not to mention the couple of pointless “tracks” that consist of an annoying little kid saying all of one sentence before the next track kicks in. Oh well, guess Van Winkle did at least invent the skit…\r\n\r\nIf you are feeling nostalgic or want a laugh, download the Ice Ice Baby video and revel on Vanilla’s white sneakers and blonde toupee, as you wonder how anybody could have bought this guy as a hardened thug. If you want some not-horrible tunes, try Hooked or Rosta Man. If you want good music, there are hundreds of other artists out there to choose from. But then again, if you want good music, why are you checking out Vanilla Ice!?", "rating": 2, "date_created_on": "2022-06-17T21:56:26.656Z", "date_edited_on": null, "creator": 1}}, {"model": "reviews.review", "pk": 5, "fields": {"album": 3, "title": "Test Title", "content": "I like it, I do not know why but I like it....    honestly", "rating": 4, "date_created_on": "2022-06-21T15:28:59.359Z", "date_edited_on": null, "creator": 1}}, {"model": "reviews.review", "pk": 6, "fields": {"album": 4, "title": "A classic pop album", "content": "An album of crisp, trebly details and steady-mechanized eighth-note pulses.

The best songs are totally classic and a few others were released rightfully as successful singles in other markets, the rest sounds much like the sound of 80s studio technology. The best songs will bring a lil bit of joy to your life, but the song Pretender sounds calculated and joyless, which became a prerequisite for far too much assembly pop in the following decades.\r\n\r\nIt really must be said though, Peter Brown and Robert Rans' hit track Material Girl is absolutely flawless!

In fact, just as the Sonics impressed and outstripped the sceptics’ expectations, Nirvana have made an LP which is not only better than anything they’ve done before, it’ll stand up as a new reference point for the future post-hardcore generation.  For starters, this makes a refreshing change from the recent crop of groups – both British and American – who’ve used the Dinosaur Jr/Husker Du sound as their base starting point. Nirvana’s rawk, instead, draws upon their roots in Sub Pop grunge, but also takes chunks of heavy ’70s bass/guitars and ideology.50  Normally, this would spell the sort of appalling disaster you’d usually associate with ITV’s autumn schedules, but Nirvana, in their defence, have attacked rock and changed the format. This is monstrous in the sense of a good drama series, rather than a cheap US thriller.  While various American grunge bands seem content to slosh around in their respective hardcore genres – albeit with some success and lucidity – Nirvana have opted out of the underground without wimping out of the creative process.  ‘Nevermind’ is a record for people who’d like to like Metallica, but can’t stomach their lack of melody; while on the other hand it takes some of the Pixies‘ nous with tunes, and gives the idea new muscle. A shock to the system. Tracks like the excellent ‘In Bloom’ and best of the lot, ‘Come As You Are’, show a dexterity that combines both a tension and a laid-back vibe that work off each other to produce some cool, constructed twists and turns.  ‘Come As You Are’ has something eerie about it, while opening track (and forthcoming single) ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ has ‘Goo’ey feeling inherent in its lurching structure. At other times, the threesome lean into thrashier territory with the berserk ‘Territorial Pissings’ and screaming-pop of ‘Breed’.  This is the natural progression from their debut LP ‘Bleach’, exploring different avenues. They are less specific lyrically than SY, sometimes annoyingly so, but yet they still produce these vivid moods with ‘Drain You’, ‘Polly’ and the closing, quieter ‘Something In The Way’.  ‘Nevermind’ is the big American alternative record of the autumn. But better still, it’ll last well into next year.”", "rating": 10, "date_created_on": "2022-09-07T09:34:18.537Z", "date_edited_on": null, "creator": 9}}, {"model": "reviews.review", "pk": 85, "fields": {"album": 7, "title": "Excellent first album", "content": "Absolutely one of Chris Cornell's best pieces of work.
